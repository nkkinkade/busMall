lab 11 for 201

This application asks users which items they find visually pleasing by asking them to click on a picture of three options and to continue choosing for a total of 25 votes. Then the statistical data is rendered on to the page as well as a graph which displays the amount some things were clicked on.

Design is based on the SkyMall webpage.
